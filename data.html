    <h1> Academic Progress Rate of NCAA Division 1 Athletes</h1>
    <p>
    According to <a href=http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/academic-progress-rate-explained> NCAA</a>, "The APR, or Academic Progress Rate, holds institutions accountable for the academic progress of their student-athletes through a team-based metric that accounts for the eligibility and retention of each student-athlete for each academic term.
    </p>
    <p> The APR is calculated as follows:</p>
    <ul>
    <li> Each student-athlete receiving athletically related financial aid earns one point for staying in school and one point for being academically eligible.</li>
    <li> A team’s total points are divided by points possible and then multiplied by 1,000 to equal the team’s Academic Progress Rate.</li> 
    <li>In addition to a team’s current-year APR, its rolling four-year APR is also used to determine accountability.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Teams must earn a four-year average APR of 930 to compete in championships."</p>
